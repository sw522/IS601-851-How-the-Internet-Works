        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Wide Web Consortium is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.  It was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee in October, 1994 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS).  The purpose of the W3C is to help guide the evolution of the web by helping develop protocols and guidelines that will help serve as the backbone.  Having a governing body for web standards helps ensure hardware manufacturers and software developers can make tools that will work properly with others throughout the internet.  Web browsers are a good example of a variety of companies developing similar programs.  A web developer will want his code to display the same way across these different applications.  If they incorporate certain w3c standards they can be certain of a consistent user experience.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML and CSS are two of the more important and ubiquitous components of the web.  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) are the instructions for a web browser on how to render the page.  HTML consists of a series of “tags” that tell the browser what to do with certain pieces of information.  A tag can make something bold, italicized, link to another URL, etc.  W3C publishes recommendations of certain iterative version as new functionality is introduced.  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a companion technology to markup languages like HTML.  CSS can be used to specify details about the elements such as fonts, colors, positioning, etc.  The significance behind CSS is its ability to separate a documents content from its presentation.  This allows developers to tweak the visual layout of a page without altering the data in the html file.</p>
