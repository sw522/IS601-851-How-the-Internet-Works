        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is a non-profit organization, not affiliated with the government, that is responsible for IP address space allocation, protocol parameter assignment, domain name system management, and root server system management functions.  Prior to the formation of ICANN, these responsibilities fell under IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) which was administered principally by Jon Postel at the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California, under a contract USC/ISI had with the United States Department of Defense.  In August 2016 ICANN incorporated Public Technical Identifiers, a non-profit affiliate corporation in California, to take over the IANA.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICANN does not hand out ip addresses or domain names, it acts as the central authority between the entities that perform these services in order to ensure the security, stability and interoperability of the Internet.  It has an accreditation process to vet the companies and draws up contracts to make sure they follow appropriate guidelines.  The process governing changes to the existing network are typically brought forth through one of the main 3 supporting organizations, each of which handle ip addresses, domain names and county top level domains respectively.  A report is created and is distributed for public review.  There is then an iterative process until all parties are in agreement or the board of directors needs to make a final ruling.  While ICANN is not a government entity, since it is incorporated and located in the Untied States it is subject to US law and can be taken to court.</p>
